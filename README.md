Alzheimer’s Disease Severity Classification & Interpretability via CNN + Grad-CAM

This program explores the application of deep learning techniques to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition that remains one of the leading causes of dementia globally. Leveraging two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D CNNs), the project aims to classify brain MRI images into four dementia stages: non-demented, very mild dementia, mild dementia, and moderate dementia. In order to enhance transparency in prediction and to align AI decision-making with biomedical reasoning, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to visualize which brain regions the model focused on during classification. Although OASIS-3 was initially considered due to its longitudinal imaging and clinical depth, the project ultimately used a preprocessed version of OASIS-1, hosted on Kaggle, for its accessibility and suitability for 2D CNN frameworks. The dataset includes grayscale axial MRI slices of the brain labeled by clinical dementia rating (CDR). The CNN achieved excellent classification performance, with validation accuracy above 93% and AUROC scores exceeding 0.97 for all classes. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrated strong anatomical relevance, with attention frequently localized to the hippocampus and medial temporal regions—key biomarkers of early AD pathology. This project demonstrates the power and practicality of integrating explainable AI tools with CNNs for AD detection in clinical settings. However, limitations include reliance on 2D projections, potential overfitting due to class imbalance, and lack of generalizability beyond a single dataset. Future work should explore 3D CNNs, multi-modal data fusion, and cross-dataset validation to ensure clinical robustness.
